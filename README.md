# Video Game Sales and Genre Popularity (1980–2016)
This project explores global video game trends using a dataset of over 15,000 games released between 1980 and 2016. The goal is to uncover patterns in platform and genre popularity, regional sales dominance, and publisher performance. The project is organized into five sections, each using a specific SQL competency: Joins, Subqueries, Table Expressions, Set Operators, and Data Modifications.
